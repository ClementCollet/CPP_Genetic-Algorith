# Project-in-C++_Genetic_Algorith and TSP

We decide to study the theory behind genetic algorithm and test this out on the Travelling salesman problem. We explore multiples hyperparameters to improve convergence. We finish our project presenting a model with a genetic algorithm selecting the best hyperparameters to our TSP-genetic algorithm
